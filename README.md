The interface consists of 4 main parts:

## 1. Home page

▪︎*In this section, robot-interface and plc-interface connection status of vehicles are checked*,

▪︎*If there is any problem in the code, the errors are displayed in the log section*.

## 2. Robot Control

▪︎*Manual controls of vehicles are provided independently and as a herd*,

▪︎*The angular and linear speed, position and rotation angle information obtained from the vehicle are displayed,*

▪︎*Vehicles visualized with Opencv can be viewed from this section, wherever they are in the Gazebo simulation environment.*

## 3. Vehicle Station Tracking

▪︎*A section has been created where you can save the starting and destination locations of the vehicles by adding summary information next to them.*

▪︎*Separate records are created for each vehicle and can be deleted when no longer needed.*

## 4. Settings

▪︎*New operator registrations are made from this section.*

▪︎*The records of the map and icons used for the visualization of the Gazebo simulation environment are kept in this section.*

▪︎*This partition is secure, user login is required first to be able to operate.*
